    Pam loved to play with Connie, even though she could be a little mischievous at times.</p>

kitchen, grabbed their mom’s purse, and pulled out her wallet. Inside was exactly what
they needed: money. When they got back to the porch, they were ready for begin their
adventure!</p><br><br>

<p>The girls began their journey home. Nancy rolled the watermelon on the ground as
they crossed the highway again.  When they got back into the house, they unpacked their
groceries. However, Mom soon discovered the goods from the grocery trip. Nancy and
Pam got a big scolding, and Connie was sent home for the day. </p><br><br>
