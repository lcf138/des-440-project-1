        <p>Three little girls sat on the porch, wishing there was something fun to do. Little
Connie had come to play for the afternoon at the McNamara house. Sisters Nancy and
Pam loved to play with Connie, even though she could be a little mischievous at times.
“Let’s help out and do the grocery shopping!” Connie exclaimed in sudden
excitement. The McNamara girls nodded enthusiastically. Nancy and Pam snuck into the
kitchen, grabbed their mom’s purse, and pulled out her wallet. Inside was exactly what
they needed: money. When they got back to the porch, they were ready for begin their
adventure!<br><br>

The girls headed down the porch steps, up the street, and across a busy thruway. What
a sight it was, to see three little girls in such a dangerous setting. Nevertheless, they
pushed on, hanging a right on the next street, and walking several yards further. Finally,
they see what they have been searching for. The grocery store is just up ahead!<br><br>

Pam grabbed a cart and wheeled it into the store. They waltzed into the store and
began inspecting all the different aisles. Connie and Nancy hauled a watermelon into the
cart. They got all the essentials: chips &amp; Juicy Fruit gum.<br><br>

At the checkout, the cashier smiled down at the girls with a questioning look. They
piled the groceries onto the conveyer belt. Nancy offered their mother&#39;s wallet to the
cashier. They finished the transaction and took their bags of groceries. <br><br>

The girls began their journey home. Nancy rolled the watermelon on the ground as
they crossed the highway again.  When they got back into the house, they unpacked their
groceries. However, Mom soon discovered the goods from the grocery trip. Nancy and
Pam got a big scolding, and Connie was sent home for the day. <br><br>

The girls weren’t allowed to attend the State Fair that weekend. However, they did get to
munch on some fresh watermelon!</p>
